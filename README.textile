h1. Ruby Template

This is just a basic folder structure that I get sick of recreating everytime I want to create a new project

Creating a rubygen template would be a more sensible long term solution but this'll do for the moment.

h1. Usage

. bin/paths

Sourcing the paths script will set the GEM_HOME, GEM_PATH and PATH environment variables so that all gem dependencies are isolated to a gem repository that lives in this project.

install_gems

The install_gems script will now be on the path.  Running it will install any gems (rake only right now) to an isolated gem repository in gems/repository

Now, go for it adding new code - add any gems you need to the %gems/gem_deps.rb% file

It also includes a console command that initialises wirble and sketches (and whatever else you want to load in lib/console_helper.rb)
