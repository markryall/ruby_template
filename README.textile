h1. Ruby Template

This is just a basic folder structure that I get sick of recreating everytime I want to create a new project

Creating a rubygen template would be a more sensible long term solution but this'll do for the moment.

h1. Usage

In a new shell session run:

. bin/paths

The paths script will set the GEM_HOME, GEM_PATH and PATH environment variables so that all gem dependencies are isolated to a gem repository that lives in this project.  Apart from any gem commands (such as spec, cucumber and rake) it will put a few commands from the bin directory on your path:

* install_gems

Running install_gems will install any gems you don't already have listed in the gems/gem_deps.rb file to an isolated gem repository in gems/repository

Adding any additional gems to gems/gem_deps.rb and your collaborators will be able to easily install them.

This uses the gem_collector.rb file written by Mike Williams (mdub).

* console

It also includes a console command that launches irb initialising wirble and sketches.

Anything else you add to the lib/console_helper.rb file will be automatically loaded.
